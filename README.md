## About

Template project for creating [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) sketches using the following tools:

- Code editor: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Other tools: [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)

See also [other templates](https://fal-works.github.io/p5js-templates/).


## Usage

### Prepare your environment

In general, the below only need to be done once.

1. Install the software as follows:

   - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (VS Code in short)
   - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

2. Install the following VS Code extension:

    - [Prettier - Code formatter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)  
    (from CLI: `code --install-extension esbenp.prettier-vscode`)

### Create your sketch

Do the below each time you create a new sketch using this template.

1. Create your sketch folder by copying this template.

2. Enable the VS Code extension for Prettier (see above), if disabled.

Now Prettier works automatically each time you save your code.  

### Edit your sketch

1. Feel free to edit `script.js`.

2. Open `index.html` to see the result.


## If you're curious

The VS Code extension for Prettier includes its own bundled version of Prettier (see also the Readme of the extension), which is why this template works without having any npm dependencies.
